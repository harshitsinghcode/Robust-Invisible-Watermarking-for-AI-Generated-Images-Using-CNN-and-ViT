# **Robust Invisible Watermarking for AI-Generated Images Using CNN \& ViT**

## 📖 **Overview**

This project presents a state-of-the-art **deep learning-based watermarking system** that embeds and extracts invisible watermarks in AI-generated images. By combining **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**, it ensures watermark robustness against tampering, compression, and other distortions while maintaining imperceptibility.

Developed under the prestigious **Samsung PRISM Program**, this project represents an innovative approach to intellectual property protection for AI-generated content.

## ✨ **Key Features**

- **CNN-Based Watermarking**: A CNN encoder-decoder model for embedding and extracting invisible watermarks.
- **ViT-Based Tampering Detection**: A Vision Transformer (ViT) to analyze image features and detect tampering with high accuracy.
- **Robustness Against Distortions**: Handles noise, compression, blurring, and more without compromising watermark integrity.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses quantitative measures like **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)** and **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)** to assess performance.
- **Custom Dataset Support**: Easily integrates with datasets like Flickr8k or other image repositories.

## 🛠️ **Installation**

To set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.ecodesamsung.com/harshitkumar-singh2022/Robust-Invisible-Watermarking-for-AI-Generated-Images-Using-CNN-ViT.git
cd robust-watermarking
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Prepare your dataset:
    - Place your image dataset in the `data/flickr8k/images/` directory.
4. Ensure GPU support (optional):
    - Install CUDA if you plan to train models on a GPU.

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### Training

1. Train both CNN and ViT models by running:

```bash
python train.py
```

2. Modify hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or number of epochs directly in `train.py` for better control over training.


## Requirements (If not using Docker)
- Python 3.10
- torch, torchvision, Pillow, opencv-python, etc.

## Docker Instructions
1. Build:
   docker build -t prism-watermark:v1 .
2. Run:
   docker run --rm prism-watermark:v1

## Dataset
`data/flickr8k/images/`.

### Testing and Evaluation

1. Evaluate the watermarking system by running:

```bash
python test.py
```

2. The script outputs key metrics like PSNR and SSIM for performance evaluation.

## 📊 **Results**

The following table summarizes the performance of our watermarking system based on testing:


| Metric | Value |
| :-- | :-- |
| **PSNR (dB)** | 34.21 |
| **SSIM (0–1 scale)** | 0.8951 |

These results demonstrate that our system achieves robust watermarking while maintaining high image quality.
